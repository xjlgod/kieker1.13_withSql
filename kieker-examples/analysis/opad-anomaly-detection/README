Description:
This example shows how OPAD is used to detect anomalies and plot the data using R.

Prerequisites:
- R (https://www.r-project.org/) has to be installed an be in the PATH of your operating system
- The Rserve package has to be installed within R
  (Start R and install the "Rserve" package by issuing "install.packages("Rserve"))


1. Start Rserve with:
    - Linux: ./rserve-control.sh start
    - Windows: rserve-control.bat start
    
2. Execute the gradle build
    - Linux: ./gradlew runAnalysis
    - Windows: gradlew.bat runAnalysis
    (This can take a few minutes to complete)
    
3. The resulting data can be found in output-data/ and the corresponding plots in output-plots/

4. Stop Rserve with:
    - Linux: ./rserve-control.sh start
    - Windows: rserve-control.bat start
